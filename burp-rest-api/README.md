# burp-rest-api

## Overview

A REST/JSON API to the Burp Suite security tool.

Upon successfully building the project, an executable JAR file is created with the Burp Suite Professional JAR bundled
 in it. When the JAR is launched, it provides a REST/JSON endpoint to access the Scanner, Spider, Proxy and other
 features of the Burp Suite Professional security tool.

## Try it out

### Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Gradle
* Licensed Burp Suite Professional version 1.7.03 or later from: <http://portswigger.net/burp/>


### Build & Run

1. [Download](https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html) the Professional edition of Burp Suite. You _may_ use Free edition but capabilities are limited.
2. Create a `lib` folder under the project directory and place the Burp Suite JAR file into it.
3. The project can be run either by running the Gradle Spring `bootRun` command or by directly launching the JAR
 created from building the project:

```
    gradlew bootRun # for pro edition, or
    gradlew bootRun "-Dburp.edition=free" # for free edition
```

or

```
    # build the jar (note that testing phase will fail if you provide free edition jar in ./lib)
    gradlew clean build
    # and run it
    java -jar build/libs/burp-rest-api-1.0.0.jar # for pro edition, or
    java -jar build/libs/burp-rest-api-1.0.0.jar --burp.edition=free # for free edition
```
The version number of the JAR should match the version number from `build.gradle` while generating the JAR.

## Documentation

### Configuration

By default, Burp is launched in headless mode with the Proxy running on port 8080 and the REST endpoint running on
 8090.

To __run Burp in UI mode__ from the command line, use one of the following commands:

With the `bootRun` command:
```
    gradlew bootRun -Djava.awt.headless=false
```
or
```
    gradlew bootRun -Dheadless.mode=false
```

With the executable JAR:
```
    java -jar burp-rest-api-1.0.0.jar -Djava.awt.headless=false
```
or
```
    java -jar burp-rest-api-1.0.0.jar --headless.mode=false
```


To __modify the server port__ on which the API is accessible, use one of the following commands:

With the `bootRun` command:
```
    gradlew bootRun -Dserver.port=8081
```
or
```
    gradlew bootRun -Dport=8081
```

With the executable JAR:
```
    java -jar burp-rest-api-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8081
```
or
```
    java -jar burp-rest-api-1.0.0.jar --port=8081
```

### Command Line Arguments

The following command line arguments are used only by the extension to configure the run mode and port number.

`--server.port=<port_number>` : The REST API endpoint is available at the given port number. `--port=<port_number>`
 works as short hand argument.

`--headless.mode=<true/false>` : When set to false, runs Burp Suite in UI mode. Otherwise runs Burp Suite in headless
 mode. Default value: System Property (java.awt.headless)

Command line arguments passed to the executable burp-rest-api JAR are forwarded to the Burp Suite JAR. Hence, one may
 pass the following Burp Suite JAR command line arguments to the burp-rest-api JAR for the same functionality as if
 passing to the Burp Suite JAR directly.

`--project-file=<filename>` : Opens the specified project file. The file will be created as a new project if it doesn't
 exist already.

`--config-file=<filename>` : Opens the project using the options contained in the selected Burp configuration file. To
 load multiple configurations, this argument can be passed more than once with different values.

For more information on Projects, refer to the Burp Suite documentation
 [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_burp_projects.html).


### Default Burp Configuration ###

If the burp-rest-api JAR is launched without the `--project-file` and `--config-file` arguments, then Burp Suite is
 launched with a temporary project file and some default configuration. The temporary project file gets created upon
 launch of Burp Suite, and gets deleted at the end of the run.

For the default configuration used to launch Burp Suite, refer to the files _burp-default-project-options.json_ and
 _burp-default-user-options.json_ inside the JAR under the _static_ folder.

### HTTP API

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is used to define API documentation. Once the JAR is launched, access the following
 resources for API docs and Swagger UI. Port 8090 is the default server port.

API Docs: http://localhost:8090/v2/api-docs

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html#/

### Client

This project also comes with a client (_BurpClient.java_) written in Java for use in other projects. Refer to the
 Integration Test file _BurpClientIT.java_ for the usage of _BurpClient.java_.
